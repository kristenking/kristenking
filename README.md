  <h2>   Hi, I'm Kristina! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/K9Xy6osm73DbxIa8f2/giphy.gif" width="40"></h2>



I am a Full Stack Developer with over 3 years experience in React.js and Node.js. Currently, I'm working towards my AWS certification 🌟 to enhance my skill set in cloud services and exploring unit testing and Rails 7 for several ongoing projects. I also share my knowledge and experiences on React and Node through my blog on dev.to/kristinadev.

With a strong background in UX/UI design, I use tools like Figma 🖌️ and Adobe Illustrator 🎨 to bring my ideas to life.


🌟 Here are some of the technologies I work with:

⚛️ React <br>
🟨 JavaScript <br>
🌿 MERN <br>
🚀 Node.js <br>
🔴 Rails 7 <br>
🔷 TypeScript <br>
☁️ AWS <br>
🖌️ Figma <br>
🎨 Adobe Illustrator <br>


I believe that collaboration, constant learning, and sharing knowledge are crucial for growth and success in the tech industry. Let's connect and build something amazing together! 💪
