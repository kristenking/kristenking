I am a Full Stack Developer with over 3 years experience in <strong>React.js</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>. Currently, I'm working towards my <strong>AWS</strong> certification and practicing unit <strong>testing</strong> and <strong>Rails 7</strong> for several ongoing projects. I also share my knowledge and experiences on React and Node through my <strong>blog</strong> on dev.to/kristinadev.

With a strong background in <strong>UX/UI</strong> design, I use tools like <strong>Figma</strong> 🖌️ and <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> 🎨 to bring my ideas to life.


🌟 Here are some of the technologies I work with:

⚛️ React <br>
🟨 JavaScript <br>
🌿 MERN <br>
🚀 Node.js <br>
🔴 Rails 7 <br>
🔷 TypeScript <br>
☁️ AWS <br>
🖌️ Figma <br>

I believe that collaboration, constant learning, and sharing knowledge are crucial for growth and success in the tech industry. Let's connect and build something amazing together! 💪
