I am a Full Stack Developer with over 3 years experience in React.js and Node.js.

I also share my knowledge and experiences on React and Node through my blog on dev.to/kristinadev.

With a strong background in UX/UI design, I use tools like Figma 🖌️ and Adobe Illustrator 🎨 to bring my ideas to life.
